Hei Simon,

We are stuck in the MP2, it would be super cool if you could help us. 
We are using a Source, a Sink and a PubSubSystem class. 
Sources and Sinks connect to the PubSubSystem. It works fine 
just from Source to PubSub. The problems start when we connect also a sink. 
We can forward some messages from a source process over the PubSub to a sink, but 
not all and we get a lot of exception. We think the problem can be easily solved in case we
could distinguish in the PubSub which connections are sources and which are sinks as soon as they connect, 
is there a way to figure this out?

Further, we create a new socket and stream for each read/write in the sink/source, we think this is necessary 
but we are not sure about that.

The following link leads to our repo where you can check out our code:

Thanks a lot!
